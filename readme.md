# Notes
This project was not designed to be fast, efficient, reliable, or stable. It was just a fun project.

# Future Ideas
 - Implement remaining instructions
 - Look into using `java-locator` crate to find Java SE Platform files. Never mind, looks questionable.
 - Optimization
    - dynasm could be use for converting bytecode to unoptimized native code. That might be a fun challenge.
    - If I want to be a bit more professional, maybe look into dynamically building with llvm.
